Built a project using python libraries for financing.
Step 1- Dowloading required database for each stock in the stock market.
I used yfinance library of python which gives all the data for stocks and keeps updating it after each working day.

Step 2- Setting up the tokens as each company has a unique token name which is used to get the data.
Step 3- Setting up the time period of data. 1 month is written as "1mo."
Step 4- using the to_string function.
        the "to_string" function gives us the data for the entire specified timeline. Normally the code will give the data for the first 5 days and the last five days.
